                 Galleon Hotel in the full crush of the luncheon hour. Nearly every seat was occupied, and small
                 additional tables had been brought in, where floor space permitted, to accommodate latecomers,
                  with the result that many of the tables were almost touching each other. Jerton was beckoned by 
                  a waiter to the only vacant table that was discernible, and took his seat with the uncomfortable
                   and wholly groundless idea that nearly every one in the room was staring at him. He was a youngish 
                   man of ordinary appearance, quiet of dress and unobtrusive of manner, and he could never wholly rid 
                   himself of the idea that a fierce light of public scrutiny beat on him as though he had been a 
                   notability or a super-nut. After he had ordered his lunch there came the unavoidable interval 
                   of waiting, with nothing to do but to stare at the flower- vase on his table and to be stared at 
                   (in imagination) by several flappers, some maturer beings of the same sex, and a satirical-looking 
                   Jew. In order to carry off the situation with some appearance of unconcern he became spuriously 
                   interested in the contents of the flower-vase.
