                        <p> We are all about Kenelm Jerton entered the dining-hall of the Golden Galleon Hotel in
                             the full crush of the luncheon hour. Nearly every seat was occupied, and small additional
                              tables had been brought in, where floor space permitted, to accommodate latecomers, with 
                              the result that many of the tables were almost touching each other. Jerton was beckoned by 
                              a waiter to the only vacant table that was discernible, and took his seat with the uncomfortable 
                              and wholly groundless idea that nearly every one in the room was staring at him. He was a youngish 
                              man of ordinary appearance, quiet of dress and unobtrusive of manner, and he could never wholly rid
                               himself of the idea that a fierce light of public scrutiny beat on him as though he had been a notability
                                or a super-nut. After he had ordered his lunch there came the unavoidable interval of waiting, with nothing 
                                to do but to stare at the flower- vase on his table and to be stared at (in imagination) by several flappers, 
                                some maturer beings of the same sex, and a satirical-looking Jew. In order to carry off the situation with
                                 some appearance of unconcern he became spuriously interested in the contents of the flower-vase.
